## Abstract

Monitoring cropsâ€™ biotic and abiotic responses through sensors is crucial for conserving resources and maintaining crop production. Existing sensors often have technical limitations, measuring only specific parameters with limited reliability and spatial or temporal resolution. Wearable sensing systems are emerging as viable alternatives for plant health monitoring. These systems employ flexible materials attached to the plant body to detect nonchemical (mechanical and optical) and chemical parameters, including transpiration, plant growth, and volatile organic compounds, alongside microclimate factors like surface temperature and humidity. In smart farming, data from real-time monitoring using these sensors, integrated with Internet of Things technologies, can enhance crop production efficiency by supporting growth environment optimization and pest and disease management. This study examines the core components of wearable standalone systems, such as sensors, circuits, and power sources, and reviews their specific sensing targets and operational principles. It further discusses wearable sensors for plant physiology and metabolite monitoring, affordability, and machine learning techniques for analyzing multimodal sensor data. By summarizing these aspects, this study aims to advance the understanding and development of wearable sensing systems for sustainable agriculture.
