## Abstract

The importance of implementing recirculating drainage for greenhouse strawberries is often overlooked because of the low electrical conductivity (EC) of drainage and transpiration despite the large area of cultivation in Korea. In this study, we analyzed the growth of strawberry crops and their water and individual nutrient use efficiency when using closed-loop hydroponics in greenhouses. The study consisted of two parts: Experiment (Exp) 1 and Exp 2, each of which employed a different closed-loop hydroponic control method. In Exp 1, the system was controlled solely based on the EC of the drainage mixed with raw water. In Exp 2, the nutrient solution (NS) was corrected according to the ion concentrations in the drainage, with correction intervals of 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and no correction, while the control treatment was open-loop. In Exp 1, a prolonged increase in drainage EC resulted in an imbalance in NS ion composition and reduced fruit yield. In Exp 2, the NS composition was stabilized through periodic nutrient correction, and the fruit yield of the closed-loop treatments did not differ from the open-loop treatment. However, the closed-loop with 2- and 4-week correction in Exp 2 showed 94% and 88% higher nutrient use efficiency (NUE), respectively, than an open-loop system. Among the closed-loop treatments, the 2- and 4-week correction intervals had 36% and 32% higher NUE than the no-correction treatment. Furthermore, the 2-week correction interval showed a 3% improvement in NUE compared to the 4-week interval. These findings highlight the importance of considering a shorter ion correction interval for optimal NUE and normal plant growth in recirculating hydroponic systems of strawberry cultivation.
