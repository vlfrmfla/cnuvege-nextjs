## Abstract

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are utilized as essential biomarkers for plant health and the surrounding environmental conditions in light of global imperatives surrounding food security and sustainable agriculture. However, conventional VOC detection methods have inherent limitations related to operational costs, portability, in situ monitoring, and accessibility. Wearable electronic systems have garnered significant attention as an alternative method because of their capability to detect, identify, and quantify VOCs quickly and cost-effectively. This article presents a comprehensive perspective of recently developed wearable VOC monitoring sensors. It highlights various detection methods for VOCs related to plant metabolism, hormones, and environmental conditions and then multi-VOC sensing based on data-driven analysis. Emerging wearable sensor devices are comprehensively examined from the perspectives of material, structural, sensing mechanisms, and plant monitoring demonstration. The principal issues inherent in recently developed VOC monitoring techniques are discussed, and potential avenues for future research and development are identified.
